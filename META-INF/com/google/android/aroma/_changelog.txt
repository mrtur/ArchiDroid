ArchiDroid 2.3.9

- [!] Compiled with Linaro GCC 4.8.3 (14.02)
# The long fight between Linaro and default GCC toolchain is still present
# We already had a few ArchiDroid releases with Linaro and definitely the most of them with default GCC
# While you probably won't tell me if Linaro makes a difference, I'll tell you that GCC version does
# Everybody agrees that ArchiDroid compiled with GCC 4.8 is way faster than the one compiled with GCC 4.7
# The choice is between very often updated Linaro in current 4.8.3 version, and rarely updated Google's GCC toolchain in current 4.8.1 version
# Considering the fact that Linaro has all GCC commits and in addition to that some unique ones, which may, or may not, make a difference, I'd still choose the toolchain, which is more recent
# Personally I also feel that ArchiDroid is smoother when compiled with Linaro, but this may be due to updated GCC version (only) or a common placebo effect
# Anyway, it's up to you to decide if it makes a difference or not. Definitely it's not worse and we should ask "why we shouldn't use Linaro" instead of "why we should"
# I decided that even if Linaro doesn't make a difference, GCC update does and I'll compile ArchiDroid using latest released Linaro, as long as we won't face any problems
# If not because of Linaro, then at least because of updated GCC upstream, which is proven to make a difference
# This is the final decision, at least until I find a very good reason to reexamine this change. ArchiDroid is about tweaking, and Linaro definitely helps in that

- [!] Further ArchiDroid 2.X optimizations
* Placed each function and data item into its own section, this is required for below optimization (-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections)
* Enabled garbage collection of unused input sections (-Wl,--gc-sections)
* By enabling the two above options we've got binaries stripped from unused functions and variables, which (should) result in reduced load times and improved performance

- [!] Implemented ARCHIDROID_CRON
* ArchiDroid's Dnsmasq Hook (Wi-Fi Tethering) is now handled by ARCHIDROID_CRON
* ArchiDroid's DNS Daemon is now handled by ARCHIDROID_CRON
* Implemented PROCESS_MONITOR for all ARCHIDROID_INIT processes, only dnsproxy2 is active by default # This fixes rare "no network" issue reported by some AD 1.X users
