- [!] Implemented ARCHIDROID_CRON
* ArchiDroid's Dnsmasq Hook (Wi-Fi Tethering) is now handled by ARCHIDROID_CRON

* Implemented PROCESS_MONITOR for all ARCHIDROID_INIT processes, only dnsproxy2 is active by default # This fixes rare "no network" issue reported by some AD 1.X users

- BACKEND: Recompiled common ArchiDroid binaries (haveged, dnsmasq, dnsproxy2, pixelserv) to latest versions, added SGS3-optimizations including NEON
