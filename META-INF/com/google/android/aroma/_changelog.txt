ArchiDroid 2.4.3

- Improved archidroid_pixelserv
# Previously archidroid_pixelserv responded to all requests with the same 1x1 NULLGIF response (GIF89a[]![])
# This was OK but in some apps it showed our gif in binary form (GIF89a[]![]) instead of showing nothing, i.e. in Subway Surfers game
# Now we respond with a "NULL" content proper for request
# If app requests JPG, we respond with NULLJPG, if app requests TEXT, we respond with NULLTEXT etc.
# This way app "gets what it wants" and won't show something, which it can't understand to user
# Surprisingly, at least Subway Surfers doesn't show any ad right now, so it also stops some apps from displaying NULL content, instead of showing NULL in binary form :)
