ArchiDroid 2.4.5

- [!] Further ArchiDroid 2.X optimizations
* Turned back O3 flag instead of O2 for all targets (-O3)
* Performed loop invariant motion on trees. It also moved operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching. The pass also includes store motion (-ftree-loop-im)
* Created a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis. Later optimizations then may determine the number easily (-ftree-loop-ivcanon)
* Performed induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees (-fivopts)
